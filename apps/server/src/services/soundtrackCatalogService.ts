/**
 * Turns a set of curated soundtrack albums into a playable pool where the *film* is the answer.
 *
 * The trick that lets this mode reuse every other mode's machinery is the shape of the rows it
 * produces: `title` holds the film, so the existing round builder, option builder, guess check,
 * scoring, multiplayer rooms and duels all work untouched. `artist` carries the song and its
 * performer, which is what the reveal shows once the round is over.
 *
 * That field placement is load-bearing in one direction: options must never display `artist`,
 * because it names the song currently playing. A player who recognises the track by ear would
 * otherwise read the answer straight off the option list instead of knowing the film, which is
 * the entire thing being tested. `buildRoundOptions` is called with `hideArtist` for these
 * sources; see `ChallengeSource.answerIsTitle`.
