/**
 * The "hear more audio" control, and the reason it looks the way it does.
 *
 * Reveal and Skip used to be two identical ghost buttons side by side, which hid the only thing
 * that matters about them: **Skip spends the round, Reveal costs nothing.** Players read two
 * equally-weighted grey buttons, guessed that both were some flavour of giving up, and never
 * touched Reveal — so they guessed off one second of audio and lost rounds they'd have got.
 *
 * So the hierarchy is inverted here: Reveal carries the accent and the width, Skip recedes.
 * The label states the actual gain ("+3s") rather than the vague "Reveal more", and the free-ness
 * is said outright instead of being something you infer after using it once.
